# css-resume
This is a project from the course "CSS Essential Training 1" and "CSS Essential Training 2" on Lynda.com. Although I have fundamental knowledge with CSS, I am going over entire courses from the learning path "Become a Web Developer" on Lynda.com. This is for personal knowledge to help me grow my understanding of CSS styling.

## Note:
- I am not the best designer. Thus, the poor colour palette choice may be disturbing for some.
